This skill provides comprehensive design guidance for creating exceptional frontend interfaces that are both visually distinctive and cognitively intuitive.

## When to Use

Apply these guidelines when:
- Building web components, pages, or applications
- Making UI/UX design decisions
- Designing interaction patterns and information architecture
- Evaluating existing interfaces for improvements
- Ensuring production-grade design quality

## Structure

This skill consists of three complementary perspectives:

### ui-design.md
Visual design principles focused on aesthetics and brand:
- Typography and color systems
- Motion and micro-interactions
- Spatial composition and layouts
- Anti-patterns to avoid (generic AI aesthetics)
- Creating memorable, distinctive interfaces

### ux-design.md
User experience principles based on cognitive psychology and HCI:
- **Design Thinking**: Mental models, task flows, cognitive budget, context
- **Core Principles**: Objects not procedures, Modeless, Immediate feedback, Smart defaults, Progressive disclosure, Prevent don't report
- **Visual Communication**: Signifiers, visual hierarchy, Gestalt grouping, consistency
- **UX Psychology**: 43 psychology principles with definitions, application strategies, and code examples (organized by category: perception, decision-making, memory, motivation, social influence, patterns)
- Making interfaces feel natural and effortless

### hi-design.md
Sociomedia's Human Interface Guidelines (100 items):
- Comprehensive interface design principles from basic concepts to accessibility
- Form design, interaction patterns, and visual feedback
- Layout, visual design, and user experience best practices
- Based on extensive research and real-world implementation experience
- Original source: https://www.sociomedia.co.jp/category/shig

**IMPORTANT**: Great design requires all perspectives. Visual beauty without usability is frustrating. Usability without aesthetics is forgettable. Human interface principles provide a comprehensive foundation for both. Use all three documents together for complete design guidance.

## Design Philosophy

- **Intentionality over intensity**: Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is executing with precision
- **Invisible interface**: The best UX feels like no UX at all - users accomplish goals without thinking about the tool
- **Context-specific creativity**: Avoid generic solutions - design for the specific problem, audience, and constraints
- **Cognitive respect**: Every element costs mental effort - be ruthless about reducing unnecessary complexity

Reference all documents (ui-design.md, ux-design.md, and hi-design.md) together for comprehensive design guidance.
